# Path of Exile Resouce Manager

This is a resource manager(RM) extension for Firefox for the game called Path of the Exile (PoE) which is a spin-off of Diablo
before Daiblo III.

It it's the same as the one on PoE's site but adds some features like Procurement has and doesn't.

I'm also looking to add a feature that shows currency worth/values for items with them next to the stats on the items like Diablo
did.

I started working on this a couple years ago after Poe launched then got involved in other things. I'm back working on it again
and have committed myself to completing it which means not playing any games at all til I'm where I'll need to play the game to
implement said features.

I chose GitHUb for doing this because I need an https site/server to refer to the page I'm using for the extension in order for
anyone else to also be able to use the extension.

I was originally using Firefox's addon SDK with cfx. When I started on the project again, they switched to jpm and then to the
current webextensions (web-ext) which is turning out to be much simpler am I'm getting it down.
